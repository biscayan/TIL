# Section 3. Determinants
## Theorem 1.
The determinant of an n x n matrix can be computed by a cofactor expansion across any row or down any column.  
The expansion across the ith row using the cofactor is det A = ai1Ci1 + ai2Ci2 + ... + ainCin  
The cofactor expansion down the jth column is det A = a1jC1j + a2jC2j + ... + anjCnj
## Theorem 2.
If A is a triangular matrix, then det A is the product of the extries on the main diagonal of A.
