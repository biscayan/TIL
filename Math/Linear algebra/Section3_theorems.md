# Section 3. Determinants
## Theorem 1.
The determinant of an n x n matrix can be computed by a cofactor expansion across any row or down any column.  
The expansion across the ith row using the cofactor is det A = ai1Ci1 + ai2Ci2 + ... + ainCin  
The cofactor expansion down the jth column is det A = a1jC1j + a2jC2j + ... + anjCnj
## Theorem 2.
If A is a triangular matrix, then det A is the product of the extries on the main diagonal of A.  
## Theorem 3. Row Operations
Let A be a suqre matrix  
- If a multiple of one row of A is added to another row to produce a matrix B (replacement), then **det B = det A**.   
- If two rows of A are interchanged to produce B (interchange), then **det B = - det A**.  
- If one row of A is multiplied by k to produce B (scaling), then **det B = k * det A**.  
## Theorem 4. 
A square matrix A is invertible if and only if det A is not 0.  
## Theorem 5. 
If A is an n x n matrix, then det AT = det A.  
## Theorem 6. Multiplicative Property
If A and B are n x n matrices, then det AB = (det A)(det B)  
det A + B is not det A + det B in general.
