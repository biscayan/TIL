# Section 2. Matrix Algebra
## Theorem 1.
Let A, B, and C be matrices of the same size, and let r and s be scalars.  
- A + B = B + A  
- (A + B) + c = A + (B+C)  
- A + 0 = A  
- r(A + B) = rA + rB  
- (r + s)A = rA + sA  
- r(sA) = (rs)A  
## Theorem 2. 
Let A be an m x n matrix, and let B and C have sizes for which the indicated sums and products are defined.  
- A(BC) = (AB)C  
- A(B+ C) = AB + AC  
- (B + C)A = BA + CA  
- r(AB) = (rA)B = A(rB) for any scalar r  
- ImA = A = AIn  
### Warnings
- In general, AB is not BA  
- If AB = AC, then it is not true in general that B = C  
- IF AB = 0, then it is not true in general that either A = 0 or B = 0  
## Theorem 3.
Let A and B denote matrices whose sizes are appropriate for the following sums and products.  
- (AT)T = A  
- (A + B)T = AT + BT  
- For any scalar r, (rA)T = rAT  
- (AB)T = BTAT
